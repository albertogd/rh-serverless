== Prerequisites

For this lab you need an Openshift 4 cluster with cluster-admin privileges. You can create an Openshift 4 Cluster in QuickLab. Go to https://quicklab.upshift.redhat.com[https://quicklab.upshift.redhat.com], and click in New Cluster. Use `openshift4upi` template, and the region you want. Use 1 master and 2 workers. After the cluster is provisioned, you need to click on `New Bundle`, and select `openshift4upi`. In the options, in `Additional identity provider`, select `htpasswd`. You'll need in exercise 2 another user, so you won't need to configure OAuth. 

NOTE: You need to be logged in Red Hat VPN to access quicklab

NOTE: Red Hat Openshift Serverless and Knative CLI is installed in Exercise 2
