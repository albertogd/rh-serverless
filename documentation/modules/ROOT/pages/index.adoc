== Introduction

**Autoscaling serverless applications in Openshift** is a workshop to get familiar with autoscaling and Knative in Openshift. You'll start creating a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to autoscale based on CPU and Memory utilization. Then, you'll create a Quarkus serverless application using Knative. Finally, you'll release a new version of an application using a canary deployment routing only a small amount of traffic.

=== 3. Canary deployment with Knative

Route only a small part of the traffic to the new application version. Once you are confident that your new application version is working properly, route the 100% of the traffic to the new version.
