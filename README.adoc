# Autoscaling serverless applications in Openshift

https://albertogd.github.io/rh-serverless/rh-serverless/index.html[Start Autoscaling serverless applications in Openshift workshop]

## Introduction
Autoscaling serverless applications in Openshift is a workshop to get familiar with autoscaling and Knative in Openshift. You'll start creating a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to autoscale based on CPU and Memory utilization. Then, you'll create a Quarkus serverless application using Knative. Finally, you'll release a new version of an application using a canary deployment routing only a small amount of traffic.

## Exercises

### 1. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

Autoscale a PHP and a Python application based on CPU and Memory utilization.

### 2. Autoscale Serverless applications with Knative

Autoscale a Quarkus serverless application based on Requests per second.

### 3. Canary deployment with Knative

Route only a small part of the traffic to the new application version. Once you are confident that your new application version is working properly, route the 100% of the traffic to the new version.
